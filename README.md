# TinyWeather - Station

This repo holds the code for the TinyWeather weather monitoring station. The station is
a Atmel ATMega 328p 8-bit MCU connected to a BME280 sensor on a breakout board. The station
is connected to, and controlled by the [TinyWeather Controller](https://github.com/dcrussell/tw_ctrl) process.
Check it out for more information on the full project and the controller.
